                <h2>Chinese Kites</h2>
                
                <div class="diduknow">
                    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
                    <p>The first Chinese kites were used for measuring distances, which was useful information for moving large armies across difficult terrain. They were also used to calculate and record wind readings and provided a unique form of communication similar to ship flags at sea.</p>
                </div>
    
                <p><img class="prof" src="images/kites.jpg" />The Book of Mozi credits 5th Century BCE Chinese philosophers Mozi and Lu Ban with inventing the first kites. Mozi made "wooden birds" that could fly and instructed his student, Lu Ban, to do the same. Lu Ban used bamboo as it was lighter and created a "wooden bird" capable of remaining in the air for three days and holding a person. The Book of Mozi contains the earliest mentions of kites, and while they are folkloric in nature, the use of kites in China for military purposes remained constant throughout later records and for centuries.</p>

                <h2>Leonardo da Vinci</h2>

                <div class="diduknow">
                    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
                    <p>Many of Leonardo's journals were written in reverse. There are many theories why this might have been the case, but the prevailing one is that it's because he was left-handed. If he had written from left to right, he might have smudged his writing and ruined his work. It may have also been a way for Leonardo to keep his writings private. Da Vinci was known for his creativity and inventiveness, so it's no surprise that he would create such a unique and practical solution.</p>

                <p><img class="prof" src="images/da-vinci.jpg" />We know Leonardo da Vinci as one of the greatest artists to have ever lived, but he was also an early inventor and visionary who applied his creative genius to explore the possibilities of flight. In the 1480s, he used his passion for understanding the mechanics of how things worked to conceive early flying machines, including the aerial screw (helicopter), the ornithopter, parachute, and hang glider.</p>
                 
                <p>Da Vinci kept his sketches of wings and flying machines hidden away, but 400 years later his work was discovered. It is incredible to consider that he was able to envision such innovative concepts hundreds of years before they were built and flown. Da Vinci was truly a genius who left behind a legacy of invention and creative inspiration.</p>

                    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
                    <p>Because electricity had not yet been discovered, Sir Isaac Newton did most of his work by candlelight. He had a favorite dog named Diamond, and one day the dog accidentally knocked over a candle and set fire to manuscripts containing his notes from over 20 years of experiments.  Fortunately, Newton was able to persevere, recover from his loss, and continue to make great contributions to science and humanity.</p>
                </div>
    
                <p><img class="prof" src="images/newton.jpg" />In approximately 1665, Isaac Newton observed an apple falling off a tree branch and asked why it fell downward instead of up or sideways. This insight led him to develop the law of gravity, which explains why objects move the way they do. Newton's three laws of motion further explain the motion of objects in the universe and allow us to calculate and make scientifically precise predictions. Newton's work was revolutionary and laid the foundation for the development of modern physics and engineering. Newton's discoveries have helped us understand the world around us and continue to be relevant to this day.</p>

                    <p>Two months earlier, on September 19, 1783, their first hot air balloon flight was an innovative experiment witnessed by King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and over 130,000 civilians. For scientific reasons, the Montgolfier brothers chose three animals as the first passengers: a sheep, a duck, and a rooster. The sheep was thought to have similar psychological traits to humans; the duck was chosen for its ability to fly at high altitudes; and the rooster, which can't fly, was chosen to measure the altitude limits of a non-flying bird. The animals survived the flight and were hailed as "heroes of the air." King Louis XVI rewarded them with a special place in the Menagerie at the Palace of Versailles.</p>

                <p><img class="prof" src="images/balloon.jpg" />French brothers Joseph-Michel Montgolfier and Jacques-&#x00C9;tienne Montgolfier were the inventors of the first manned hot air balloon. On November 21, 1783, they successfully conducted the first untethered manned aircraft flight with their hot air balloon in the presence of King Louis XVI. The balloon, made of paper and silk, ascended to an amazing 3,000 feet above Paris and traveled about 5 miles before landing outside the city ramparts. Jean-Fran&#x00E7;ois Pil&#x00E2;tre de Rozier and Fran&#x00E7;ois Laurent d'Arlandes became the first humans to ever be lifted aloft.</p>

On December 17th, 1903, the Wright Brothers conducted the first successful flight of a powered, sustained, and controlled airplane. Orville piloted the craft, and the brothers managed to cover a distance of 120 feet in 12 seconds. They went on to complete three more flights that day, with their last attempt reaching 59 seconds of flight time.</p>

This aircraft had been specially designed to accommodate the longer wings and fuselage needed for the 33&frac12; hour journey. It was also equipped to carry the extra fuel required for the flight, which was stored in the nose and wings of the plane. It's amazing to think about the courage and skill of Lindbergh in making such a daring journey nearly a century ago.</p>

She received her license on August 1, 1911, after attaining a height of 200 feet. High-flying Harriet Quimby blazed the trail and proved cockpits aren't just for men. In 1912, she became the first female pilot to fly at night and cross the English Channel. British pilot Gustav Hamel offered to help her fake the flight by wearing her signature purple flying suit and switching places with her later. Harriet declined, and on April 16th, 1912, she successfully completed her mission despite blinding fog and having to rely solely on her compass to navigate.</p>

                    <p>Amelia Earhart recognized the importance of practicality and comfort in aviation attire and designed her own outfits for her flights, which often featured loose-fitting trousers and a leather jacket. Earhart launched her own clothing line called "Amelia Earhart Fashions." The clothes were sold at Macy's in New York and Marshall Field's in Chicago. The line was marketed as "clothes for the woman who lives actively," and its success allowed Earhart to continue funding her aviation endeavors.</p>

                <p><img class="prof" src="images/earhart.jpg" />Amelia Earhart was a trailblazing American aviation pioneer who shattered records and advocated for women's advancement in aviation. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Earhart's numerous feats as a pilot brought her international fame and helped improve public acceptance of aviation. Tragically, she disappeared without a trace while attempting to fly around the world before her 40th birthday. With 7,000 miles remaining, the plane lost radio contact near the Howland Islands. Fondly known as "Lady Lindy," she disappeared without a trace in 1937 with navigator Fred Noonan, and the mystery of their disappearance remains unsolved to this day.</p>

                <p>Despite her untimely end, Earhart's legacy as one of the world's most famous pilots remains an enduring symbol of determination and perseverance. She fearlessly challenged societal barriers and paved the way for women to pursue their passions. Her unwavering dedication to proving that women could succeed in their chosen fields, just as men did, earned her global admiration and fame. Her mysterious disappearance added to all of this and has given Earhart lasting recognition in popular culture as one of the world's most famous pilots. Even today, many people are still trying to solve the mystery of what happened to the woman who forever changed aviation </p>

In 1944, Lee was tasked with transporting a P-63 aircraft from a Bell Aircraft factory in Niagara Falls to Fargo, North Dakota. Tragically, while attempting to land in Fargo, Lee's plane collided with the wing of another P-63 due to confusion caused by the Air Traffic Control Tower. Hazel sustained fatal injuries in the crash, becoming the last of thirty-eight WASP members who lost their lives in the line of duty.</p>

                    <p>Frank Whittle was dyslexic, which makes his academic and professional accomplishments even more impressive. Despite struggling with reading and writing, Whittle excelled in mathematics and had a natural aptitude for engineering. He suffered from a stutter throughout his life. Despite this, he excelled at public speaking and became a popular lecturer in the United States, where he was highly regarded for his expertise in jet propulsion technology. The Aerospace Museum of California has one of the first Whittle jet engines on display in our exhibit hall. </p>

                <p><img class="prof" src="images/whittle.jpg" />When Frank Whittle was just fifteen years old, he applied to join the Royal Air Force (RAF). However, his short stature of only five feet led to his rejection twice. Despite this setback, Whittle persisted and applied for a third time, finally being accepted as an apprentice. By the time he was twenty-one, he had become a pilot officer and authored a thesis titled "Future Development in Aircraft Design," which proposed that aircraft could reach faster speeds at higher altitudes. His theory was met with ridicule, and he struggled to secure funding. Whittle refused to give up and set out to create the world's first turbo-jet engine. Although the RAF initially rejected his patent, with the help of some friends, he was eventually able to test his engines and achieve the first successful flight on May 15th, 1941.</p>

                    <p>During World War II, McClellan Air Force Base in California played a crucial role in the maintenance of B-17 Flying Fortresses. Women and minorities, including African Americans and Japanese Americans, were trained as mechanics and electricians to maintain the aircraft. The Women's Army Corps (WAC) played a crucial role in filling many of the non-combat positions at McClellan AFB. The WACs, made up of over 150,000 women, were responsible for clerical work, supply duties, and transportation, with some working in more technical jobs. The contributions of women and minorities at McClellan AFB were crucial to the success of the B-17 program during World War II, ensuring that the aircraft remained in top condition and ready for combat at all times.</p>

                <p>Roy D. Kelley served as a waist gunner for the Eighth Air Force 306th Bomb Group, 423rd Squadron, stationed in Thurleigh, England, during World War II. Kelley participated in the largest bomber attack of the war when he flew on a B-17 during the mission to Lille, France, on October 9th, 1942. During his eight-month tour, Kelley amassed an impressive total of 516 hours of combat flight across twenty-five missions, the majority of which he served as the pilot in command. After completing his service with the 306th, Kelley returned to the United States to become an instructor. He retired with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, having received two distinguished flying crosses after serving his country for 23 years.</p>
            
                <p>Lt. Col. Kelley represents the tens of thousands of WWII bomber aircrew who bravely served our nation. Being assigned to a bomber crew was considered a death sentence. Crews were incredibly brave, and they put their country before themselves. Approximately 71 percent, or over 100,000 aircrew, were either killed or labeled as "missing in action."</p>

                    <p>During the Russian Revolution, Sikorsky was forced to flee the country and leave behind all of his aircraft manufacturing facilities and resources. He arrived in the United States in 1919 as a penniless refugee who had nothing but his knowledge and his talent. He quickly began to rebuild his career and soon gained a reputation as an expert in helicopter design. In 1923, Sikorsky founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, which would become one of the leading helicopter manufacturers in the world. In July 2013, Aerovelo-Atlas, the world's first human-powered helicopter, which hangs near this mural, was awarded a $250,000 prize by the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation.</p>
                </div>
    
                <p>From an early age, Igor Ivanovich Sikorsky was fascinated by aviation, inspired by his mother's introduction to Leonardo da Vinci's works on flying machines. This passion led him to design the first four-engine airplanes used as bombers during World War I.</p>
                    
                <p>However, Sikorsky's most notable achievement was the invention of the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300, which became the first successful American helicopter. Through this groundbreaking invention, Sikorsky introduced the rotor configuration that is still widely used in modern helicopters today.</p>

                    <p>Cornelius Coffey was married to Willa Brown, the first Black woman to receive her pilot's license in the U.S. Coffey and Brown met while they were both studying at the Coffey School of Aeronautics. They were married in 1939 and became a formidable team in the field of aviation, working together to promote the advancement of African Americans in the field of aviation. Together, Coffey, Brown, and Janet Bragg founded the National Airmen's Association of America (NAAA) in 1939, which was one of the first organizations dedicated to promoting the interests of Black pilots and aviation professionals.</p>

                <p>Cornelius Coffey paved the way for the integration of African American pilots into American aviation. Faced with discrimination by flight schools, Coffey and John C. Robinson built their own aircraft using a motorcycle engine and taught themselves to fly before, in turn, creating their own flight school. In the 1930s, the Coffey School of Aeronautics became the first recognized aviation school for African Americans in the United States. At the time, the aviation industry was very segregated, and there were few opportunities for black pilots to receive training or find employment in the field. Many Tuskegee Airmen got their start at Coffey's school.</p>

Davis faced discrimination and segregation during his early years in the military. He was assigned to an all-black unit and was not allowed to fly or train with white pilots.  Davis was assigned to lead the all-black 99th Pursuit Squadron at Tuskegee Army Airfield in Alabama, which later became known as the 99th Fighter Squadron. Under his leadership, the 99th trained rigorously and proved their ability to fly and fight as well as any other unit. In April 1943, the squadron was sent to North Africa, where it flew combat missions in the Mediterranean theater.</p>

                <p>Davis went on to lead the 332nd Fighter Group, which included the 99th and three other African American fighter squadrons, and helped to integrate the U.S. military after the war. Davis was the first African American Major General in the United States Air Force, making him one of only a few Americans to receive a fifth star.</p>

                <h2>Curator's Notes</h2>
                <p>The traveling exhibit <em>African Americans in Aviation</em> visited the Aerospace Museum of California in August 2020. Curated by Chauncey Spencer II, the exhibit portrays the lives, struggles and histories of historic American Black Aviators - The Tuskegee Airmen, Female pilots and Astronauts.</p>

                <p>Specifically, the stories of Chauncey Spencer, Dale White, James Banning, Janet Bragg, Cornelius Coffey, and many other early African American aviators inspired Tom Jones, Executive Director and Curator of the Aerospace Museum of California. As Tom learned more about these African American aviators he realized that most people, even aviation buffs, may not know the stories of these Hidden Heroes. He commissioned and named this mural the "Hidden Heroes of Aerospace" to help tell the stories of our collective history and infuse the hidden history of these key historical figures into the timeline of aerospace history to help educate future generations.</p>

                <p>The 2016 movie "Hidden Figures" is loosely based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Margot Shetterly about three female African-American mathematicians: Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, who worked at NASA during the Space Race. Mural size limitations and the desire to highlight an additional Hidden Hero drove the selection, and addition of Mary Golda Ross to this mural.</p>

                <p>The Aerospace Museum of California is grateful to Professor Randy Schuster, Professor Veronica Torres and the administration of American River College (ARC). Their leadership, assistance and funding were integral to help bring the vision of this mural to life. The museum would also like to thank and recognize the Art Professor Sarah Mattson, Historian Jessica Williams, and student artists Rachel Pineda, Brie MacGil, and Patris Miller for their outstanding work in researching, creating and painting this incredible piece of public art.</p>
